# AcademicPlatform
A platform to share academic content.

Note: This project has not been finished yet. The idea is to build a platform where instructors of some Academic Institution (temporaly, superusers)
can share courses which content consist in text (mathjax also allow instructors to use latex format to write mathematical equations), videos, images,
another kind of files and questions to quices. Courses are sectioned in modules. There are partial and total quices. In partial quices only one module
is evaluated (the algorithm display 10 semirandom questions if there are more than 10 modular question in the data base else all questions). In total
quices it's displayed a max of 40 questions (all question for the course if there are lower than 40). Questions are checked in automatic way and grade
is displayed in the screen when user finish the evaluation. Also, students and instructors can search content using a search bar.

Right know, personalprofile app is being built.

Students (regular users) can see, at least until this stage of development, all content uploaded by instructors. The idea is to include an app, 
or to update student app, in order students can se only previously payed content. Also exits the objetive of include an app that allow user to contact
instructors, it could be a chat service or a platforms for video call meetings.
